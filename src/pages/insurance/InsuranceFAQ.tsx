        {
          q: "How do I activate my UW student health insurance?",
          a: "Your UW student health insurance is automatically active when you enroll in classes. You can access your insurance card through the MyUW portal under 'Insurance & Benefits'.",
        },
        {
          q: "Where can I find my insurance card?",
          a: "Log into MyUW portal and navigate to Insurance & Benefits. You can download a digital copy or request a physical card be mailed to you.",
        },
        {
          q: "Do I need to choose a primary care doctor?",
          a: "No, UW student health insurance doesn't require you to choose a PCP. You can visit any in-network provider, including Hall Health Center.",

      questions: [
        {
          q: "What's the difference between copay and deductible?",
          a: "A copay is a fixed amount you pay for specific services (like $20 for a Hall Health visit). A deductible ($500 annually) is what you pay before insurance covers larger expenses at 80%.",
        },
        {
          q: "Are prescriptions covered?",
          a: "Yes, most generic prescriptions have a $10-15 copay. Brand-name drugs may have higher copays. Check with your pharmacy or the AI assistant for specific medications.",
        },
        {
          q: "What happens if I reach my out-of-pocket maximum?",
          a: "Once you've paid $2,500 in qualifying expenses in a year, your insurance covers 100% of covered services for the rest of that year.",
        },
        {
          q: "Is mental health care covered?",
          a: "Yes! Mental health services at Hall Health Counseling Center are covered with the same $20 copay as other primary care visits.",

        {
          q: "Do I need a referral to see a specialist?",
          a: "For specialists at UW Medical Center, yes. Hall Health can provide referrals. Some specialists may be seen without referral - check with your provider first.",
        },
        {
          q: "What if I need care outside of UW facilities?",
          a: "You can visit any in-network provider. Check the provider directory in MyUW or call the insurance line to verify coverage before your visit.",
        },
        {
          q: "How do I file a claim?",
          a: "Most in-network providers file claims automatically. If you paid out-of-pocket, download a claim form from MyUW and submit with receipts to the address listed.",
        },
        {
          q: "What's covered in an emergency?",
          a: "Emergency care is 100% covered after your deductible at any ER, not just UW facilities. Always call 911 or go to the nearest ER for true emergencies.",
